# UiS DATPREP: COVID-19 project

In this introductory project we are modelling the first 250 days of the Corona
virus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak.
The model we are going to use is probably the simplest one possible,
and you are encouraged to keep this in mind as you reflect on what the model
can, and cannot, say.

All later projects in the course MOD510 will look very much like this one.
Therefore, working on this project should give you a good start.

## Learning objectives
By completing this project, the student will:
* Learn to import data into "pandas":"https://pandas.pydata.org" DataFrames.
* Write simple functions to generate plots, and inspect data visually.
* Constrain model parameters by comparing model output with data.
* Reflect on strengths and weaknesses of simple models for complex phenomena.
